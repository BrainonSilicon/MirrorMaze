# MirrorMaze

Mirror Maze is a VR Environment built for an experiment on visuomotor adaptation. 

Participants trace shapes that appear in a mirror in front of them. 
Because the shape is "reflected", participants have to relate the movement of their hands as seen in the mirror to the goal (successfully trace shapes and stay  inside the lines)
